  \begin{itemize}
    \item These diagnostics can help to predict how particles spread in a fluid from over a certain time interval.
    
    \item However, when you look at the lagrangian methods, they rely on the integration of particle trajections which is time consuming \& computationally expensive.
    
    \item But the eulerian approach, they use the eulerian rate of strain tensor which is calculated from the gradients of velocity i.e., here we analyze the system without integration which reduces time \& computational power. \par 

    \item Now let us look at both the approaches and compare them.
