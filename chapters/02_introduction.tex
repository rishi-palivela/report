\chapter{Introduction}
These diagnostics can help to predict how particles spread in a fluid from over a certain time interval.However, when you look at the lagrangian methods, they rely on the integration of particle trajections which is time consuming \& computationally expensive but the Eularian approach, they use the eularian rate of strain tensor which is calculated from the gradients of velocity ie; here we analyze the system without integration which reduces time \& computational power.
\par Now let us look at both the approaches and compare them:
