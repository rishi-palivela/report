\chapter{Conclusion}
These mathematical connections prove that the attraction and repulsion rates are the limits of FILE as integration time goes to 0.Additionally this manuscript also shows that for small integration time |T| << 1 eigen vectors for cauchy green strain tensor are equal to eularian rate if strain tensor.
