\chapter{Conclusion}

These mathematical connections prove that the attraction and repulsion rates are the limits of FTLE. as integration time goes to 0. Additionally this manuscript also shows that for small integration time \(|T| << 1\) eigen vectors for cauchy-green strain tensor are equal to eulerian rate of strain tensor.
